 # Digital-VLSI-SoC-OpenLane-Sky130

## üìò Project Introduction
This repository showcases the complete physical design flow using the OpenLANE toolchain with the Sky130 open-source PDK. Executed as part of Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning Workshop by VLSI System Design Corporation, the project offers a hands-on experience in chip design, starting from RTL to the final GDSII.

OpenLANE is a powerful, open-source RTL-to-GDSII automation framework that integrates tools like Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, and more ‚Äî all working cohesively to produce clean, manufacturable layouts without manual intervention. The flow is optimized specifically for the Skywater 130nm PDK, enabling the development of hard macros and full chips efficiently.

# DAY-1
## Inception-of-Open-source-EDA,OpenLane-and-Sky130-PDK

we explore the fundamental physical elements of an integrated circuit (IC) : 

**Package, Chip, Pads, Core, Die, and IPs** : 
- The QFN-48 (Quad Flat No-lead) package is a surface-mounted IC package with 48 pins used to connect the chip to the outside world.

- Inside the package is the die, the actual silicon chip where transistors are fabricated.

- The core is the functional part of the die where the logic (e.g., processor, memory) is implemented.

- Surrounding the core are pads, which act as electrical contact points for interfacing signals from the core to the pins on the package.
  
- The chip as a whole includes the die, package, and connections.

The core of the chip will contain two types of blocks:

**Foundry IP Blocks** (e.g. ADC, DAC, PLL, and SRAM) = blocks which requires some amount of intelligent techniques to build which can only be designed by foundries.

**Macro blocks** (e.g. RISC-V SOC and SPI) = pure digital logic blocks compared to IP's which might require some analog parts.
